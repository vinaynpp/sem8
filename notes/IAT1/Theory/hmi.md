  * Explain term Gulf of Execution
    * The gulf of execution is the degree to which the interaction possibilities of an artifact, a computer system or likewise correspond to the intentions of the person and what that person perceives is possible to do with the artifact/application/etc
    * In other words, the gulf of execution is the difference between the intentions of the users and what the system allows them to do or how well the system supports those actions (Norman 1988)
    * For example, if a person only wants to record a movie currently being shown with her VCR, she imagines that it requires hitting a 'record' button
    * But if the necessary action sequence involves specifying the time of recording and selection of a channel there is a gulf of execution
  * Explain term Gulf of Evaluation
    * The gulf of evaluation is the degree to which the system/artifact provide representations that can be directly perceived and interpreted in terms of the expectations and intentions of the user (Norman 1988)
    * Or put differently, the gulf of evaluation is the difficulty of assessing the state of the system and how well the artifact supports the discovery and interpretation of that state (Norman 1991)
    * "The gulf is small when the system provides information about its state in a form that is easy to get, is easy to interpret, and matches the way the person thinks of the system"
  * Explain term prototyping
    * Humans are complex and we cannot expect to get designs right first time. We therefore need to evaluate a design to see how well it is working and where there can be improvements
    * On the technical side, iterative design is described by the use of prototypes, artifacts that simulate or animate some but not all features of the intended system
    * There are three main approaches to prototyping:
      * throw-away
      * incremental
      * Evolutionary
  * List the seven stages of Donald Norman’s model
    * User to establish Goal
    * User to formulate Intention
    * Decides on action on the interface
    * Executes the action
    * Perceives system state
    * Interprets system response
    * Evaluates system with respect to goal
  * Explain Graphical User Interface.
    * A GUI is a control system that allows a user to perform commands on a connected computer or electronic device through the use of icons and other digitally created visuals
    * A common example is a touchscreen smartphone or tablet
    * Touchscreen-enabled mobile devices such as these produce visuals on the screen, which the user can interact with to control the device
    * If a user wants to browse the internet on a tablet, for instance, he or she can tap the icon for the device’s mobile web browser
    * Because the interface is digitally created on a screen, it’s considered a GUI
  * What are the Common interaction styles?
    * The concept of Interaction Styles refers to all the ways the user can communicate or otherwise interact with the computer system.
    * The concept belongs in the realm of HCI or at least have its roots in the computer medium, usually in the form of a workstation or a desktop computer.
    * These concepts do however retain some of their descriptive powers outside the computer medium.
    * For example, you can talk about menu selection (defined below) in mobile phones.
    * The types of interaction styles mentioned are usually command language, form fillin, menu selection, and direct manipulation.
  * Explain direct manipulation.
    * Direct manipulation is an interaction style in which the objects of interest in the UI are visible and can be acted upon via physical, reversible, incremental actions that receive immediate feedback.
    * The action of using your fingertips to zoom in and out of the image is an example of a direct-manipulation interaction.
    * Another classic example is dragging a file from a folder to another one in order to move it.  
* 5    marks questions
  * Explain reasoning with its types.
    * Reasoning is the process by which we use the knowledge we have to draw conclusions or infer something new about the domain of interest.
    * There are a number of different types of reasoning
      * deductive
        * Deductive reasoning derives the logically necessary conclusion from the given premises.
        * For example, If it is Friday then she will go to work It is Friday Therefore she will go to work.
        * It is important to note that this is the logical conclusion from the premises; it does not necessarily have to correspond to our notion of truth.
        * So, for example, is a perfectly valid deduction, even though it conflicts with our knowledge of what is true in the world.  
      * inductive
        * Induction is generalizing from cases we have seen to infer information about cases we have not seen.
        * For example, If every elephant we have ever seen has a trunk, we infer that all elephants have trunks.
        * Of course, this inference is unreliable and cannot be proved to be true; it can only be proved to be false.
        * We can disprove the inference simply by producing an elephant without a trunk.
        * However, we can never prove it true because, no matter how many elephants with trunks we have seen or are known to exist, the next one we see may be trunk less.
        * The best that we can do is gather evidence to support our inductive inference.
      * abductive
        * The third type of reasoning is abduction. Abduction reasons from a fact to the action or state that caused it.
        * This is the method we use to derive explanations for the events we observe.
        * For example, suppose we know that Sam always drives too fast when she has been drinking.
        * If we see Sam driving too fast we may infer that she has been drinking.
        * Of course, this too is unreliable since there may be another reason why she is driving fast: she may have been called to an emergency, for example.
        * In spite of its unreliability, it is clear that people do infer explanations in this way, and hold onto them until they have evidence to support an alternative theory or explanation.
        * This can lead to problems in using interactive systems

  * Explain Ergonomics.
    * Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of the interactions among human and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.  
    * Ergonomics is important because when you’re doing a job and your body is stressed by an awkward posture, extreme temperature, or repeated movement your musculoskeletal system is affected. Your body may begin to have symptoms such as fatigue, discomfort, and pain, which can be the first signs of a musculoskeletal disorder.
    * Arrangement of controls and displays:
      * Considered perceptual and cognitive issues that affect the way we present information on a screen and provide control mechanisms to the user. In addition to these cognitive aspects of design, physical aspects are also important. Sets of controls and parts of the display should be grouped logically to allow rapid access by the user.
    * The physical environment of the interaction:
      * As well as addressing physical issues in the layout and arrangement of the machine interface, ergonomics is concerned with the design of the work environment itself.
      * The first consideration here is the size of the users. Obviously this is going to vary considerably. However, in any system the smallest user should be able to reach all the controls (this may include a user in a wheelchair), and the largest user should not be cramped in the environmen
    * Health issues:
      * Leaving aside the obvious safety risks of poorly designed safety-critical systems (aircraft crashing, nuclear plant leaks and worse), there are a number of factors that may affect the use of more general computers. Again these are factors in the physical environment that directly affect the quality of the interaction and the user’s performance:
    * Physical position:
      * As we noted in the previous section, users should be able to reach all controls comfortably and see all displays. Users should not be expected to stand for long periods and, if sitting, should be provided with back support. If a particular position for a part of the body is to be adopted for long periods (for example, in typing) support should be provided to allow rest.
    * Temperature:
      * Although most users can adapt to slight changes in temperature without adverse effect, extremes of hot or cold will affect performance and, in excessive cases, health. Experimental studies show that performance deteriorates at high or low temperatures, with users being unable to concentrate efficiently.
    * Lighting:
      * The lighting level will again depend on the work environment. However, adequate lighting should be provided to allow users to see the computer screen without discomfort or eyestrain. The light source should also be positioned to avoid glare affecting the display.
    * Noise:
      * Excessive noise can be harmful to health, causing the user pain, and in acute cases, loss of hearing. Noise levels should be maintained at a comfortable level in the work environment. This does not necessarily mean no noise at all. Noise can be a stimulus to users and can provide needed confirmation of system activity.
    * Time:
      * The time users spend using the system should also be controlled. It has been suggested that excessive use of CRT displays can be harmful to users, particularly pregnant women.
    * The use of color:
      * Ergonomics has a close relationship to human psychology in that it is also concerned with the perceptual limitations of humans. For example, the use of color in displays is an ergonomics issue.
  * What are Norman's design principles?
    * 1. Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head.
      * People work better when the knowledge they need to do a task is available externally – either explicitly or through the constraints imposed by the environment. But experts also need to be able to internalize regular tasks to increase their efficiency. So systems should provide the necessary knowledge within the environment and their operation should be transparent to support the user in building an appropriate mental model of what is going on.
    * 2. Simplify the structure of tasks.
      * Tasks need to be simple in order to avoid complex problem solving and excessive memory load. There are a number of ways to simplify the structure of tasks. One is to provide mental aids to help the user keep track of stages in a more complex task. Another is to use technology to provide the user with more information about the task and better feedback. A Downloaded from: annauniversityedu.blogspot.com 36 third approach is to automate the task or part of it, as long as this does not detract from the user’s experience. The final approach to simplification is to change the nature of the task so that it becomes something more simple. In all of this, it is important not to take control away from the user.
    * 3. Make things visible:
      * bridge the gulfs of execution and evaluation. The interface should make clear what the system can do and how this is achieved, and should enable the user to see clearly the effect of their actions on the system.
    * 4. Get the mappings right.
      * User intentions should map clearly onto system controls. User actions should map clearly onto system events. So it should be clear what does what and by how much. Controls, sliders and dials should reflect the task so a small movement has a small effect and a large movement a large effect.
    * 5. Exploit the power of constraints, both natural and artificial.
      * Constraints are things in the world that make it impossible to do anything but the correct action in the correct way. A simple example is a jigsaw puzzle, where the pieces only fit together in one way. Here the physical constraints of the design guide the user to complete the task.
    * 6. Design for error.
      * To err is human, so anticipate the errors the user could make and design recovery into the system.
    * 7. When all else fails, standardize.
      * If there are no natural mappings then arbitrary mappings should be standardized so that users only have to learn them once. It is this standardization principle that enables drivers to get into a new car and drive it with very little difficulty – key controls are standardized. Occasionally one might switch on the indicator lights instead of the windscreen wipers, but the critical controls (accelerator, brake, clutch, steering) are always the same.
  * Explain Goal directed design process.
    * 1. Research:
      * In this stage you collect qualitative data about the users or potential users through field studies and interviews. You carry out a competitor analysis and interview key stakeholders to gather their requirements. When you’re finished you should be left with a set of instructions which describe how the product could be used.
    * 2. Modelling:
      * The modelling stage can be broken down into two parts. In part one you define the domain model by building on the workflow patterns from the research stage. In part two you define the user model through the use of personas or key archetypes which represent identifiable groups of users.
    * 3. Requirements Definition:
      * Stage three is critical for providing that link between the user model and other models. In this stage you focus on context scenarios to help define ‘a day in the life’ of a persona. You also consider business goals, technical considerations and brand guidelines during this stage but it’s the context scenarios which really make a big impact to the way you think and help generate a ton of ideas you might not have considered before.
    * 4. Framework Definition:
      * During the framework definition stage you create the overall product concept and define the behaviour and visual design of the product. You can also create prototypes during this stage.
    * 5. Refinement:
      * In the refinement stage you place more focus on detail and refinement and at the end of this stage it’s recommended that you create your design documentation.
    * 6. Development Support:
      * No matter how clear the vision is for the product things can and do change during development, budgetary and timeline concerns can affect which features get taken away or which new ones get added and it’s critical that the designer is on hand to offer advice and to make sure the overall design quality doesn’t get compromised.
